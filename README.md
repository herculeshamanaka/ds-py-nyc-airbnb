# New York City Airbnb Data Analysis
In this project I'm using an Airbnb file for NYC. It's a summarized file version but it's possible to have some insights already. The analysis was made using Jupyter notebook.

I tried to extract the most relevant topics at a first look into the dataset.

Some relevant data regarding NYC neighbourhood was also extracted from the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

There is also some cool map features to check.
